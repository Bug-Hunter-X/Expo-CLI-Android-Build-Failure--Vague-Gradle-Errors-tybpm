Several strategies can help resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning the project's build cache using `expo prebuild --clean` followed by a fresh build with `expo build:android`. 

2. **Check Android Dependencies:** Ensure that all Android dependencies are correctly specified and compatible with each other in your `android/build.gradle` files. Examine the error message carefully for any hints related to missing or conflicting libraries. 

3. **Update Android Tools:** Update your Android SDK and build tools to the latest versions. Outdated components are a frequent source of build issues. 

4. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio or your IDE. Sometimes, cached data corrupts the build process. 

5. **Check for Internet Connection:**  Verify that you have a stable internet connection as downloading dependencies is critical to successful builds. 

6. **Examine Gradle Logs:**  The complete logs for the Gradle build process usually offer valuable clues.  Search for specific error messages or warnings. 

7. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If none of the above helps, create a minimal project that still reproduces the issue. This isolated example is easier to debug and share for community assistance.
